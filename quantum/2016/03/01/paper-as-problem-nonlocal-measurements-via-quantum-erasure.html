<p>(<em>In &#39;Paper as Problem&#39; posts, I treat a paper&#39;s abstract as a puzzle.
&quot;We discovered a way to X&quot; becomes &quot;Figure out how to do X&quot;.
The goal is to solve the problem before reading the body of the paper.</em>)</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, the paper &quot;Nonlocal Measurements via Quantum Erasure&quot; by Aharon Brodutch and Eliahu Cohen <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.070404">was published in Physical Review Letters</a>.
There&#39;s also a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1575">pre-print available on arXiv</a>, which is what I read.</p>

<p>Based on the abstract, the paper&#39;s core contribution is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[...]
We present a scheme for effectively generating the von Neumann Hamiltonian for nonlocal observables without the need to communicate and adapt.
[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>The paper is about measuring non-local observables involving qubits spread over multiple parties, with the caveat that the parties can&#39;t just send the qubits to each other (they don&#39;t have access to quantum channels).</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to measure the Z-parity of two qubits (i.e. whether their spins agree or disagree along the Z axis).
A simple way to recover the Z-parity is to measure each qubit along the Z axis, and compare the results.
The problem with measuring both qubits along the Z axis, by measuring the $Z_1$ observable and the $Z_2$ observable, is that it disturbs the system more than only measuring the Z-parity observable $Z \otimes Z$.</p>

<p>Suppose you took two qubits and prepared them so that a bit $x$ was stored in the X-parity observable $X \otimes X$ and a bit $z$ was stored in the Z-parity observable $Z \otimes Z$ (which is the trick behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding">superdense coding</a>).
$X \otimes X$ commutes with $Z \otimes Z$, but it <a href="/quantum/2016/01/19/unknown-but-equal.html">doesn&#39;t</a> commute with $Z_1$ or $Z_2$.
As a result, measuring either of the individual Z-values in the process of recovering the $z$ bit will destroy the $x$ bit.
To recover both $x$ and $z$, we need to measure <em>only</em> the non-local observables $Z \otimes Z$ and $X \otimes X$.
Not the local observables $Z_1$ or $Z_2$ or $X_1$ or $X_2$.</p>

<p>When both qubits are in the same quantum computer, measuring $X \otimes X$ and $Z \otimes Z$ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state#Bell_state_measurement">is easy</a>.
Just CNOT one of the qubits onto the other, hit the former control with a Hadamard, then measure both qubits.
But, in the paper&#39;s problem, the qubits are on separate quantum computers.
We can&#39;t perform that crucial controlled-not operation.</p>

<p>So a concrete form of the paper&#39;s core problem is: how can measure we the Z-parity of two qubits, without disturbing the X-parity of the two qubits, when those two qubits aren&#39;t in the same quantum computer?</p>

<h1>My Solution</h1>

<p>After thinking for a minute, it occurred to me that quantum teleportation would make this problem trivial.
If we had access to pre-shared entanglement, we could burn it to teleport Alice&#39;s qubit to Bob, have Bob perform the measurement locally, then teleport the qubit back.
We&#39;d have performed a non-local measurement, but at the cost of 2 bits of entanglement and 4 bits of classical communication to power the teleportations.</p>

<p>I then realized I could cut the cost in half by throwing away the second half of the first teleport and the first half of the second teleport.
<a href="/quantum/2015/12/28/Separating-Quantum-Teleportation.html">Copy-teleporting</a> Alice&#39;s qubit to Bob, then erasing Bob&#39;s entangled copy after performing the measurement, is sufficient; and only costs 1 bit of entanglement and 2 bits of classical communication.</p>

<p>(<em>Side note: It&#39;s tempting to think of copy-teleporting one way then erasing the other way as a sort of &quot;temporary teleportation&quot;.
That&#39;s an okay intuition for this post but, because the sender still has an entangled copy during the temporary teleport, there are caveats in the general case.</em>)</p>

<p>Putting that idea into circuit form gives <strong>my guess at the solution to the paper&#39;s core problem</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-03-01-paper-as-problem-nonlocal-measurements-via-quantum-erasure/measuring-parity-under-locc.png" alt="Measuring parity under locc via entanglement" style="max-width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>The process shown above:</p>

<ul>
<li>(prep) Create 1 bit of pre-shared entanglement</li>
<li>(prep) Create the unknown input state $\psi$</li>
<li>(prep) Give half of $\psi$ to Alice ($\psi_1$) and the other half ($\psi_2$) to Bob</li>
<li>Copy-teleport an entangled copy of $\psi_1$ from Alice to Bob

<ul>
<li><em>costs 1 bit of entanglement</em></li>
<li><em>costs 1 bit of classical communication</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perform the Z-parity measurement at Bob&#39;s, using $\psi_2$ and his entangled copy of $\psi_1$</li>
<li>Erase Bob&#39;s entangled copy of $\psi_1$

<ul>
<li><em>costs 1 bit of classical communication</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the parity measurement can be replaced by other combined measurements of the two qubits.
Also note that, although the diagram just says $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ for the circuit&#39;s output, the qubits storing $\psi$ have been decohered along $Z \otimes Z$ by the measurement.</p>

<p>After coming up with the above solution, I started worrying about the requirement of pre-shared entanglement.
Was the paper going to come up with some clever way of avoiding it?</p>

<p>No.
Definitely not.</p>

<p>Suppose we took two qubits, each in the unentangled state $\ket{0} + \ket{1}$, and measured their parity.
If the parity measurement was even, the qubits are now in the state $\ket{00} + \ket{11}$; otherwise they&#39;re in the state $\ket{01} + \ket{10}$.
By hitting one of the qubits with a NOT when the parity measurement was odd, the qubits end up unconditionally entangled into the state $\ket{00} + \ket{11}$.</p>

<p>In other words: a non-local parity measurement can create 1 bit of entanglement.
But generating entanglement is impossible in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOCC">local-operations-and-classical-communication (LOCC)</a> regime we&#39;re operating in (for a bunch of reasons; e.g. it would allow us to clone qubits).
So it must cost at least 1 bit of entanglement to perform non-local parity measurements, else we&#39;d be generating entanglement for free.</p>

<p>Performing a non-local measurement requires at least 1 bit of entanglement, and we have process that achieves that bound.
Based on that, I predicted that the paper&#39;s solution to the problem was basically my circuit above.</p>

<h1>The Paper&#39;s Solution</h1>

<p><em>*Craig reads the paper.*</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Argh! So close!</em></strong>
My solution was on the right track, but I overlooked a crucial part of the problem statement: &quot;without the need to communicate and adapt&quot;.
We&#39;re not working in the regime of local-operations-with-classical-communication, we&#39;re working in the regime of local-operations-with-after-the-fact-note-comparing.</p>

<p>In practice, experimental physicists have a hard time bouncing messages between one quantum system and another during an experiment.
It&#39;s much <em>much</em> easier for them to do post-processing of the results.
For example, <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2464">one of the recent loophole-free tests of Bell&#39;s inequality used entanglement swapping</a> but they didn&#39;t perform the conditional phase-corrections needed to make entanglement swapping work consistently.
Instead, they simply threw out the runs ruined by the lack of corrections.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the the easiest way to cut communication out of a protocol, after all: just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postselection">post-select</a> that it wasn&#39;t necessary.
Assert that the communicated value will be 0, then compare notes after the fact and throw away any experiments that failed to meet the assertion.</p>

<p>The paper&#39;s solution is exactly mine, except with communication replaced by post-selection:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entanglement and communication resources for our scheme are at most equivalent to a single round of teleportation.
This can be compared to the naive strategy of teleporting, measuring and teleporting back.
[...]
However, the motivation for the protocol is the fact that it can be implemented without communication or adaptive components.
[...]
From a practical perspective we can easily imagine other situations such as linear optics, where the resources necessary for an adaptive scheme that requires communication outweigh the advantage of a deterministic protocol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s the paper&#39;s diagram of their non-local measurement process:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-03-01-paper-as-problem-nonlocal-measurements-via-quantum-erasure/paper-diagram.png" alt="Measuring parity under locc via entanglement" style="max-width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>And here&#39;s the same thing again, but in my diagrammatic style (and performing a parity measurement instead of the alternative non-local measurement they were doing):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2016-03-01-paper-as-problem-nonlocal-measurements-via-quantum-erasure/measuring-parity-using-post-selection.png" alt="Measuring parity under locc via entanglement, using post-selection instead of communication" style="max-width: 100%;"/></p>

<p>Note the similarities between the above diagram and the diagram for my initial solution.
They&#39;re exactly the same, except operations controlled by remote values have been replaced with post-selection that the operation was unnecessary (due to the control not being satisfied).
This avoids communication during the protocol, though of course it still requires some after-the-fact coordination where Alice and Bob tell each other which runs they ruined.</p>

<p>The downside of post-selecting is that we&#39;ll lose three quarters of the runs, because each post-selection has a 50/50 chance of failing.
The losses get exponentially worse as the number of involved qubits increases: a non-local measurement that involves moving $m$ qubits via post-selection will only succeed $4^{-m}$&#39;th of the time.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>You can measure non-local observables by using pre-existing entanglement and post-selection to temporarily teleport entangled copies of qubits.</p>

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1575">The paper</a> goes into plenty of details not covered in this post, such as explaining how to parameterize the strength of the non-local measurement.</p>
