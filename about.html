<h1 class="posts_list_title">About the Blog</h1>

<p>
  Algorithmic Assertions is a computer science blog.
  Posts are usually technical, on the order of a couple thousand words long, and focused on some idea in mathematics, software engineering, algorithmic complexity, quantum computing, or computers in general.

  I go by "Craig Gidney".
  I've programmed my whole adult life, both for fun and for profit.
  In 2013, I got interested in quantum computing and started learning it independently.
  In 2017, I joined Google's quantum computing team as a software engineer.
  I then gradually transformed into a research scientist, with a focus on reducing the cost of quantum algorithms and quantum error correction.
  I like showing things can be done 10x cheaper than previously believed
  (such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03662">chemistry</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749">factoring</a>,
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17595">magic state prep</a>,
  and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15917">factoring again</a>).
  I also write software tools, like <a href="https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim">stim</a> and <a href="https://algassert.com/quirk">quirk</a> and <a href="https://algassert.com/crumble">crumble</a>.
