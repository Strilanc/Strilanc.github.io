<h2>The Blog</h2>

<p>
Algorithmic Assertions is a computer science blog.
Posts are usually technical, on the order of a couple thousand words long, and focused on some idea in mathematics, software engineering, algorithmic complexity, or computers in general.
</p>

<p>
Posts are often framed around some insight I had into a problem I was thinking about, even if that insight is unoriginal and obvious in hindsight.
Lately there's been a lot of undergrad-level quantum computing posts, because that's what I've been interested in.

  Although my <em>work</em> work doesn't involve a ton of computer science, I learn and think about it a lot in my spare time.
  That's why this blog exists.
