<h1 class="posts_list_title">About the Blog</h1>

<p>
  Algorithmic Assertions is a computer science blog.
  Posts are usually technical, on the order of a couple thousand words long, and focused on some idea in mathematics, software engineering, algorithmic complexity, quantum computing, or computers in general.

  Although my <em>work</em> work doesn't involve a ton of theoretical computer science (as opposed to coding), I learn and think about it a lot in my spare time.
  That's why this blog exists.
