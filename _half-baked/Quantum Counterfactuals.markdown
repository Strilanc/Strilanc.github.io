Quantum mechanics continues to weird out and amaze.

Mach-Zhender interferometer.

Putting a mirror on the bottom takes it away.

**Counterfactual Bomb Detection**

Quantum bomb detector. The other world fails to check in, and so you know they were destroyed.

Tweak so the beam splitters are on the same side, using an optical delay. Someone placing or not placing the mirror can send you a message over the noisy channel.

**Counterfactual Key Generation**

Polarize the photons either vertically or horizontally.
Use a polarization splitter to capture horizontally oriented photons.
Alice and Bob both rotate by either 0 degrees or 90 degrees.
Photons interfere if rotation agrees. So we can detect when they differ.
Use inputs where differ was detected as key.
