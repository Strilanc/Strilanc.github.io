# Example Comments:
- **Reasonable Opponent**: This is a ridiculous comment system. Why would you do this?
    - **Craig Gidney**: I don't know what you mean. I think it's great! Merge conflicts are fun for everyone.
                        (Well... actually I'm trying this as an experiment in minimalism and avoiding Disqus.)
        - **Reasonable Opponent**: It still seems like a bad idea.
            - **Craig Gidney**: Maybe. If it doesn't work out, I'll just stop putting it on new posts.
- **Spambot**: It is extremely impressive that I managed to make this comment.
