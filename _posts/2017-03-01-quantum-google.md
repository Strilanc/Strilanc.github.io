I have really exciting news.
This month I'm moving from New York to Santa Barbara, to become part of the [quantum ai team at Google](https://research.google.com/pubs/QuantumAI.html)!

If you've been following news or [talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgMWommXxU8) about quantum stuff at Google, then you already know why I'm excited.
I don't know if Google will be first to hit quantum <strike>supremacy</strike> ascendancy, where an actual quantum computer can do some task, *any task*, even an esoteric one, faster and cheaper than existing supercomputers.
And I don't know if humanity is at the beginning of a quantum information era, or if that's still ten or twenty years away.
But I think it's a good bet, or at least an *interesting* bet, and I'm honored to have some small part in that.

Given the news, I feel the need to clearly restate some disclaimers about this blog.

This is a blog about computer science and software development trivia, not a blog for timelines or industry editorials.
The stuff I write about will continue to be chosen independently of what I'm working on professionally, unless otherwise noted.
If I write about quantum-thing-X, it's because _**I**_ found quantum-thing-X interesting.
Not because Google is or isn't interested in quantum-thing-X.

But still, any opinion I express on this blog is my own and only my own.
I don't speak for Google.
Or for the quantum ai team.
Obviously.
